[Connect The Four]
Hi,
My program for Connect The Four has 2 main array: a 2D and 1D - arrays for storing elements. I prefer 2D as it is more straightforward, but I also make a 1D array as required.
My functions will include a main function, initializing and printing the board, a method for checking if the move is valid, 2 methods for checking wins and draws, and 2 methods for player and AI. 
First, my program will ask if the player wants to go first, then proceed in turn of the players. My main method will print out the initial and final state via and initialboard() and board() method.
During the game, the board and move chosen will be called in player1() and player 2() method also via board() method. My player1() will be the bot which makes basic moves of defensing first,
then attacking,or else randomly making a move if no strategies can be thought of. My player2() method will be the input method for the player, it also check the valid of the moves made, 
and asked the player to choose again if the move is invalid. Meanwhile, my player1() and player2() method will also check if the move helps they win, and return a value (1), so that 
the main method will do its work of announcing the final state.
